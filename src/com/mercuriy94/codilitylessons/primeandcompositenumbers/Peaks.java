/**
 * A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
 * <p>
 * A peak is an array element which is larger than its neighbors. More precisely,
 * it is an index P such that 0 < P < N − 1,  A[P − 1] < A[P] and A[P] > A[P + 1].
 * <p>
 * For example, the following array A:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 1
 * A[1] = 2
 * A[2] = 3
 * A[3] = 4
 * A[4] = 3
 * A[5] = 4
 * A[6] = 1
 * A[7] = 2
 * A[8] = 3
 * A[9] = 4
 * A[10] = 6
 * A[11] = 2
 * has exactly three peaks: 3, 5, 10.
 * <p>
 * We want to divide this array into blocks containing the same number of elements.
 * More precisely, we want to choose a number K that will yield the following blocks:
 * <p>
 * A[0], A[1], ..., A[K − 1],
 * A[K], A[K + 1], ..., A[2K − 1],
 * ...
 * A[N − K], A[N − K + 1], ..., A[N − 1].
 * What's more, every block should contain at least one peak.
 * Notice that extreme elements of the blocks (for example A[K − 1] or A[K]) can also be peaks,
 * but only if they have both neighbors (including one in an adjacent blocks).
 * <p>
 * The goal is to find the maximum number of blocks into which the array A can be divided.
 * <p>
 * Array A can be divided into blocks as follows:
 * <p>
 * one block (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2). This block contains three peaks.
 * two blocks (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4) and (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2). Every block has a peak.
 * three blocks (1, 2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 1, 2), (3, 4, 6, 2). Every block has a peak.
 * Notice in particular that the first block (1, 2, 3, 4) has a peak at A[3],
 * because A[2] < A[3] > A[4], even though A[4] is in the adjacent block.
 * However, array A cannot be divided into four blocks, (1, 2, 3), (4, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3) and (4, 6, 2),
 * because the (1, 2, 3) blocks do not contain a peak.
 * Notice in particular that the (4, 3, 4) block contains two peaks: A[3] and A[5].
 * <p>
 * The maximum number of blocks that array A can be divided into is three.
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 * <p>
 * that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers,
 * returns the maximum number of blocks into which A can be divided.
 * <p>
 * If A cannot be divided into some number of blocks, the function should return 0.
 * <p>
 * For example, given:
 * <p>
 * A[0] = 1
 * A[1] = 2
 * A[2] = 3
 * A[3] = 4
 * A[4] = 3
 * A[5] = 4
 * A[6] = 1
 * A[7] = 2
 * A[8] = 3
 * A[9] = 4
 * A[10] = 6
 * A[11] = 2
 * the function should return 3, as explained above.
 * <p>
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * <p>
 * N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000].
 * <p>
 * RESULT:
 * Task Score - 100%
 * Correctness - 100%
 * Performance - 100%
